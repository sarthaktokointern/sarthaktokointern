Footprint of google cloud platform: It is in 20 regions, 61 zones, 134 network edge locations, and 200+ countries and territories.

Region: It is a collection of various/multiple data centres

Zone: It can be associated with a data centre and when google launches a new region it typically has at least 2 zones and the idea of a zone provides higher
availability, reliability and redundancy to customers. When customers launch applications they use more than one zone making their application highly
available.

Network edge locations: They deliver stain content which will enhance the user
experience.

The big picture of google cloud platform:

There are various building blocks of google cloud platform:
1.) Bottom layer or the foundation layer:
a.) compute: At the bottom of the stack we have compute and it is the most critical building block of cloud infra.
b.) storage: It provides durability and persistence to the applications.
c.) network: It enables communications across multiple applications and services offered by google.
2.) Additional Services layer:
a.) Database: It includes both nosql databases and relational databases.
b.) Data and Analytics: Offer business intelligence and data warehouse in the cloud.
3.) AI and Machine learning services
4.) It includes Hybrid and multi cloud, API management and migration services
5.) Management tools which deliver services through which customers can interact and manage their deployments and cloud infra

Note: We have security and devops that cut across the stack because they are not specific to a layer, they are important for all the services
