1.) cloud storage -> it is a unified cloud storage service, it lets you store data (structured/unstructured) in the form of objects or containers known as buckets.

2.) cloud big table -> it is a nosql database i.e. the data can be structured as well unstructured. You will be having your data stored
in a server, and you can process your data. It deals with data which has low latency that is quick processing is required.

3.) cloud datastore -> it is also a nosql database. Deals with data which is hierarchical in nature.

4.) cloud sql -> for dealing with structured data

5.) persistent disks -> it is a block storage and depends upon the host machine/system for access. For instance, we have our hard disks in which
we can store data, but we need to connect it to certain system to access that data.

note -> block storage comes in 2 parts : fml storage and persistent storage. fml storage dies with your instance whereas persistent 
storage doesn't as it is created separately and can be attached or detached to the instance
