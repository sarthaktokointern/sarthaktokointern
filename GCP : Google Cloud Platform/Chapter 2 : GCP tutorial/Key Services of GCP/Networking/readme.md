1.) cloud virtual network -> we can put certain set of resources in a particular network, suppose we have 100 devices so we can assign 
those 100 devices to a particular network.

2.) cloud load balancing ->  diverts the traffic in such a way that each and every server is not overloaded

we can do horizontally as well vertical scaling on the basis of traffic.

note -> horizontal scaling -> increasing the number of  servers
vertical scaling -> increasing the computation power of a single server
