Applications -> 

1.) it provides tools to fast track the migration process from on premise or other clouds to gcp. If a user is starting
with the public cloud, then they can leverage these tools to seamlessly transfer existing applications from their data center.

2.) Genomics data processing -> processing genomic data is  computationally intensive because the info is enormous with 
vasts sets of sequencing. this can be done with the help of google compute engine with ease because the platform is not 
only flexible but even scalable.

3.) Bring your own licenses images -> a compute engine can help run your windows apps in gcp by bringing their licenses to the
platform as either license-included images or sole-tenant nodes.
